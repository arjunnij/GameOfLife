# GameOfLife

Introduction 

John Conway's Game of Life is a game which is based on simple mathethematical rules but can often produce complex and interesting patterns. In the game, there is a board composed of cells. Given a starting configuration input by the users, the cells either "die" or become "alive" if the following conditions are met: 

- if a cell is alive, it stays alive if it has two or three neighbors which are alive
- if a cell is alive, it dies if it has more than three neighbors (overpopulation) 
- if a cell is alive, it dies if it has less than two neighbors 
- if a cell is dead, it becomes alive if it has three neighbors (reproduction)
